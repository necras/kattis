## My solutions to Kattis problems
This repository contains my solutions to [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), in order to track my progress.
It contains a separate project for each problem, included is a script to reduce some monotony when starting new problems.

```sh
./dl_problem <problem_name>
```
e.g
```sh
./dl_problem detailed_differences
```


The sample files to test the problems are not included in this repository and should be downloaded separately, check script for details.
